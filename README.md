## MyReads: A Bookshelf App
* This app allows users to select and categorize books the users are currently reading, want to read, or have read.
* Users can search for books and include them to their bookshelf.

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
